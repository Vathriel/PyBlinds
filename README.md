# PyBlinds
A super simple blinds program with open/close and sunrise/sunset features. 
It's meant to be used in conjunction with a raspberry pi and 5v motor. 

The sunrise/sunset feature does not use a light sensor, rather it pulls from a web api.
Specifically: https://sunrise-sunset.org/api

I do not plan on supporting this project further, it has met it's goals.
